## Hello! This is repository of classification.

In this repository, i read the paper, implement the architecture, review the paper using quote used in paper. 
Each paper have good accuracy and SOTA of each year so i feel need to understand this features of papers.

So i try to implement architecture similary, except the training process because my environment is not optimized for the training process. Except the detail of training, i set up the training process, weight intialization in this repository, file name "train.py", "weight init" and i think these processes can be adapted in most of the structures.
