## Hello! This is repository of classification.

In this repository, i read the paper, implement the architecture, review the paper using quote used in paper. 
Each paper have good accuracy and SOTA of each year so i feel need to understand this features of papers.

So i try to implement architecture similary, except the training process because my environment is not optimized for the training process.
