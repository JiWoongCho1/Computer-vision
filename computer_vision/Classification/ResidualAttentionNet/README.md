## Residual Attention Network


Attention not only serves to select a focused location but also enhances different representations of objects at that location. No attention mechanism has been applied to feedforward network structure to achieve state-of-art results in image classification task. Recent advances of image classification focus on training feedforward convolutional neural network. Inspired by the attention mechanism and recent advances in the deep neural network, authors proposed Residual Attention Network, a convolutional network that adopts mixed attention mechanism in "very deep" structure.

Apart from more discriminative feature representation brought by the attention mechanism, this model also exhibits following appealing properties. 1) Increasing Attention Modules lead to consistent performance improvement, as different types of attention are captured extensively. 2) It is able to incorporate with state-of-the art deep network structures in  an end-to-end training fashion.
