## EfficientNet

Scaling up ConvNets is widely used to achieve better accuracy. For example, resNet can be scaled up from ResNet=18 to ResNet-200 by using more layers. However, the process of scaling up ConvNets has never been weel understood and there are currently many ways to do it. The most common way is to scale up ConvNets by their depth, width. Another less common,, but increasingly popular, method is to scale up models by image resolution. In previous work, it is common to scale only one of the three dimensions. In this paper, they want to stydy and rethink the process of scaling up ConvNets. In particular, they investigate the central question: is there a principled method to scale up ConvNets that can achieve bettter accuracy and efficiency? Their empirical stydy shows that it is critical to balance all dimensions of network width/depth/resolution, and surprisingly such balance can be achieved by simply scalin
