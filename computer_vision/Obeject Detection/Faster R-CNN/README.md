## Faster R-CNN

Although region-based CNNs were computationally expensive as originally developed, their cost has been drastically reduced thanks to sharing convolutions across proposals. The latest incarnation, Fast R-CNN achieves near real time rates using very deep networks, when ignoring the ime spent on region proposals. Selective search, one of the most popular methods, greedily merges superpixels based on engineered low level features. Yet when compared to efficient detection networks, Selective search is an order of magnitude slower, at 2 seconds per image in a CPU implementation. EdgeBoxes currently provides the best tradeoff between proposal quality and speed, at 0.2 seconds per image. Nevertheless, the region proposal step still consumes as much running time as the detection network. 
 
 In this paper, they show that an algorithmic change leads to an elegant and effective solution where proposal computation is nearly cost-free given the detection network's computation. To this end, they introduce novel _Region Proposal Network_(RPNs) that share convolutional laers with state-of-the-art object detection networks. By sharing convolutions at test time, the marginal cost for computing proposals is small.(10ms per image). Their observation is that the convolutional feature maps used by region-based detectors, like Fast R-CNN, can also be used for generating region proposals. On top of these convolutional features, they construct an RPN by adding a few additional convolutional layers that simultanesously regress region bounds and objectness scores at each location on a regular grid. The RPN is thus a kind of fully convolutional network and can be trained end-to-end specifically for the task for generating detection proposals.
